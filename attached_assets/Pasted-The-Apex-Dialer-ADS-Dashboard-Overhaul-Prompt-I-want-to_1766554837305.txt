The "Apex Dialer & ADS Dashboard" Overhaul Prompt
"I want to overhaul the UI/UX of this application, specifically focusing on the Dialer page and the brand identity. We are moving away from the 'slow-moving glass' effects and toward a high-performance, 'AAA Command Center' aesthetic that is energizing but professional.

Please implement the following specific upgrades:

1. The 'ADS Dashboard' Dynamic Logo (Water & Electricity)
Visual Concept: Create a custom SVG logo component for 'ADS'.

The 'Water' Element: The letters should have a subtle, fluid fill animation (using an SVG mask) that looks like deep blue liquid slightly swaying.

The 'Electricity' Element: Every 3–5 seconds, a sharp, bright cyan/white 'arc' or 'spark' should trace the outline of the letters rapidly, like a high-voltage circuit pulsing.

Refinement: The animation must be subtle enough not to be a distraction but sharp enough to look high-tech. Remove any 'glass' blur behind the logo.

2. The 'High-Energy' Dialer Page (Core Workspace)
The Layout: The Dialer is the cockpit. Center the dialer interface, but surround it with 'Tactical Modules' (Call History, Lead Insights, Scripting).

Visual Style: Move from 'Glass' to 'Matte Stealth.' Use deep carbon grays (#0D0D0D) with high-definition, razor-thin borders (0.5px) in a muted electric blue.

Energizing Feedback: * When a call is 'Connecting,' the border of the dialer module should 'spin' with a faint electrical glow.

When 'Active,' the UI should subtly breathe with a soft emerald green light in the periphery.

Information Density: Ensure contact data is extremely crisp. Use a monospace font (like 'JetBrains Mono') for phone numbers and timestamps to give it a 'Mission Control' feel.

3. Removing the 'Sluggishness'
Kill the Glass: Remove all backdrop-filter: blur and slow CSS background animations that feel 'heavy.'

Performance: Replace them with 'High-Frequency' interactions. Use Framer Motion for 'Spring' animations—buttons should snap back instantly when clicked, not fade slowly.

Texture: Use a very subtle digital 'noise' or 'grid' overlay on the background to create texture without the performance hit of blur effects.

4. The 'Billion-Dollar' Interactive Elements
The Keypad: Numbers should have a 'mechanical keyboard' feel—subtle 3D depth that 'presses' down on click with a tiny spark of light.

Action Buttons: The 'Hang Up' button should feel heavy and significant (glowing red-orange); the 'Mute' and 'Transfer' buttons should look like aircraft toggle switches.

Status Indicators: Use 'Live' indicators—tiny pulsing dots that look like actual hardware LEDs.

5. Technical Requirements
Stack: Use Tailwind CSS for the layout and Framer Motion for all physics-based movement.

Logo Logic: Use a React component with animate presence for the electricity arcs.

Clean Code: Ensure the logic of the Dialer (the actual calling functionality) remains untouched; only wrap the existing components in this new high-fidelity visual shell."
