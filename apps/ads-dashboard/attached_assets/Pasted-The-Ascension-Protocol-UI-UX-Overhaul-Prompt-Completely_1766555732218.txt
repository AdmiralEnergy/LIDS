The "Ascension Protocol" UI/UX Overhaul Prompt
"Completely overhaul the visual architecture of this CRM. We are moving away from 'Web Dashboard' and into a 'High-Performance Tactical HUD.' The goal is to make the Sales Rep feel like an elite pilot. Focus heavily on the Dialer and the Gamification systems.

1. The 'ADS' Kinetic Logo (Signature Brand Asset)
Visuals: Create a custom SVG logo for 'ADS' that combines fluid dynamics and electricity.

The 'Water' Core: Use an SVG displacement map filter to create a 'liquid' waving effect inside the text. The fill should be a deep cerulean blue gradient.

The 'Electric' Arc: Use a secondary SVG layer to animate a 'Lightning' stroke. Use stroke-dasharray and a rapid framer-motion loop to make white-hot electrical sparks trace the perimeter of the letters erratically.

Remove: Get rid of all blurred background boxes behind the logo. It should sit clean and sharp against the dark background.

2. The 'Atmospheric' Background (Zero-Latency Particles)
Implementation: Instead of a static image or a slow CSS gradient, implement a Lightweight Canvas Particle System.

Effect: Have 30–50 'Electric Sparks' (tiny 1-2px cyan and gold dots) drifting at varying speeds with a slight 'jitter.' Occasionally, have two sparks 'arc' a line between each other.

Depth: Use a very subtle digital grid overlay (20px squares at 5% opacity) that moves slightly with the mouse to create a 3D parallax effect.

3. The 'Plasma' XP Bar (The Dopamine Loop)
Aesthetics: The XP bar should look like a contained energy tube. Use a thick, semi-transparent border with a high-intensity inner glow (box-shadow: inset 0 0 10px).

The Fill: The progress bar fill must use a multi-layered gradient that looks like flowing plasma.

Gamification FX: When the XP increases:

The bar should 'flash' bright white.

A 'Shockwave' effect should emanate from the current progress point.

The numerical value should use a 'slot-machine' rolling animation with a slight motion blur.

Engagement: Add a small 'Level' badge next to the bar that 'pulses' with a gold aura when the rep is on a hot streak.

4. The Dialer 'Cockpit' (Immersive Command)
Style: Deep Obsidian matte surfaces (#050505) with 0.5px glowing 'Neon' borders.

Interaction: When a call is active, the entire Dialer module should have a 'Breathe' animation using a soft Red/Emerald glow depending on call status.

Feedback: Buttons must have zero-latency spring physics (use type: "spring" in Framer Motion). When hovered, a 'scanning light' beam should pass across the button face.

Typography: Use 'Geist Mono' or 'JetBrains Mono' for all dynamic data (phone numbers, timers, XP counts) to ensure a high-tech, precise look.

5. Technical Instruction
Global Theme: Force the Refine/Mantine/AntD theme to a pure black (#000000) base.

Performance: Ensure all animations are GPU-accelerated (transform: translateZ(0)).

UI Polish: Add a 2% 'Film Grain' overlay to the entire body to break up flat digital colors and give it a premium, cinematic texture."
