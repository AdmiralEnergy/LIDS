## Marketing Plan

**Location:** LifeOS-Core (47+ pages - DO NOT attempt to read in context)
**Access:** MUSE agent should have RAG/chunked access
**Content:** Full marketing strategy, brand voice, target audience, content pillars

---

## TikTok Workflow Complexity

Creating TikTok content requires multiple steps:
1. **Script** - MUSE/Sarai generates based on marketing plan
2. **Voiceover** - AI or Leigh records
3. **Video footage** - Stock, AI-generated, or screen recording
4. **Subtitles** - Canva or CapCut
5. **Music/Sound** - TikTok trending sounds
6. **Posting** - Manual or API scheduled

**Reality Check:** Expecting all steps automated in one go is "hopeful at best, delusional at worst"

---

## Progression System Requirements

Leigh needs her own gamified progression like sales reps have:
- **XP Sources:** Canva courses, posts created, engagement metrics, TikTok shop sales
- **Framework:** Octalysis (same as ADS)
- **Integration:** Could be RedHawk Academy path or Studio-specific

---

## Key Constraints

1. **No complex file operations** - Leigh can't navigate file explorer
2. **Clear step-by-step** - Every task needs explicit instructions
3. **Mobile-friendly** - Dashboard should work well on tablet/phone
4. **Agent hand-holding** - MUSE must be available to walk through tasks
5. **Minimize context switches** - Keep workflow within Studio as much as possible

---

## Success Metrics

- Posts per week (target: daily TikTok)
- Engagement rates
- Lead magnet conversions
- TikTok Shop revenue
- Canva course completions
- Progression level advancement
