## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document defines Admiral Energy's multi-channel sales cadence strategy. Research demonstrates that precision targeting with multi-channel cadences yields **5-7% call-to-meeting conversion** versus ~2% for random calling. The NC Solar Trust-Builder Cadence is our primary sequence.

**Key Insight:** 44% of homeowners interested in solar can't find a company they trust. Our cadence is designed to build trust through consistent, value-driven touchpoints—not pressure.

# SECTION 1: WHY CADENCES WIN

## 1.1 The Problem with Call Spamming

| Spam Calling Effect | Business Impact |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| Phone flagged as "Spam Likely" | 24-32% of numbers pre-flagged by carriers |
| Prospect annoyance | Brand damage before first word spoken |
| Lead burnout | Calling non-responders 10x = wasted opportunity |
| Rep burnout | Average SDR tenure: 15 months |
| Compliance risk | Excessive calling → harassment claims |

## 1.2 The Cadence Advantage

| Factor | Call Spamming | Strategic Cadence |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| Dials to Meeting | 50-100 dials | 15-30 dials |
| Prospect Experience | "Stop calling me!" | "Oh, you emailed me about..." |
| Rep Experience | Constant rejection | Meaningful conversations |
| Compliance Risk | High | Low (controlled, documented) |
| Conversion Rate | ~2% | **5-7%** |

## 1.3 The Psychology of Multi-Touch

```
Touch 1: RECOGNITION  → "I've heard of them"
Touch 2: CONSIDERATION → "They might be legitimate"
Touch 3: FAMILIARITY   → "I know what they offer"
Touch 4: TRUST         → "Others vouch for them"
Touch 5: READINESS     → "I'm willing to talk"
```

Each touch reduces resistance and builds credibility. By the time you call, you're not a stranger—you're someone they've "seen around."

## 2.2 Day-by-Day Execution Guide

### DAY 0: SPEED-TO-LEAD

**Actions:**
1. Send Email 1 (Lead Magnet Delivery)
2. Call within 5-10 minutes of download

**Goal:** Verify receipt of guide + human connection

**Call Script (Permission-Based):**
```
"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] with Admiral Energy in [City], NC. 
I saw you grabbed our Solar Savings Checklist—I'm not calling to pitch you, 
just wanted to make sure it landed in your inbox okay?"
```

**If No Answer - Voicemail:**
```
"Hey [Name], this is [Your Name] from Admiral Energy. 
Just wanted to make sure you got the solar guide you downloaded. 
I'll send a quick email with the link again just in case. 
No need to call back unless you have questions. Take care!"
```

**Why Speed Matters:**
- Leads contacted within 5 minutes are 21x more likely to convert
- After 30 minutes, response rates drop 100x

---

### DAY 1: NO CONTACT

**Action:** Nothing

**Why:** Avoids "desperate telemarketer" perception. Let them read and absorb the guide. Shows you're not pushing—you're helping.

---

### DAY 2: VALUE CALL + EMAIL

**Actions:**
1. Send Email 2 (Key Benefits/Win)
2. Call in afternoon (different time block from Day 0)

**Goal:** Reference the email to bridge the gap

**Call Script (Curiosity Hook):**
```
"Hi [Name], I sent over a tip this morning about the new federal tax credits. 
It got me thinking—did you know [Their County] has specific incentives 
that stack on top of the federal credit?"
```

**NC-Specific Hooks:**
- Duke Energy's PowerPair program
- Net metering policy changes
- Local utility rate increases

**If They Engage:**
Ask discovery questions:
- "What's your average monthly Duke Energy bill?"
- "Have you experienced any outages in the last year?"
- "Have you looked into solar before, or is this new territory?"

---

### DAY 3: SOCIAL TOUCH

**Action:** View their LinkedIn profile (if available)

**Why:** This is a "soft touch" that shows research without being intrusive. Many people see LinkedIn profile views. It signals:
- You're a real person
- You did some homework
- You're not just a call center bot

**Optional Expansion:**
- Light engagement on public social posts
- Do NOT send connection request yet (too early)

---

### DAY 5: SOCIAL PROOF EMAIL

**Action:** Send Email 3 (Case Study)

**Content Guidelines:**
- Feature a local NC homeowner (preferably nearby county/city)
- Show specific numbers (savings amount, bill reduction %)
- Include a quote/testimonial
- End with soft CTA: "Curious if you'd see similar results? Reply and I'll run a quick analysis for your home."

**Why This Works:**
- 87% of consumers say reputation matters in solar decisions
- Local social proof builds trust (peer validation)
- Testimonials work better than company claims

---

### DAY 6: POWER HOUR CALL

**Timing:** Tuesday, 10-11 AM (data shows higher connect rates)

**Goal:** Overcome "Trust Deficit"

**Call Script (Differentiation):**
```
"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from Admiral Energy. 
I know a lot of folks in NC are skeptical because of all those 
'free solar' robocalls going around. 

I wanted to clarify—we're a local [City] installer, veteran-owned, 
not a call center. Have you had a chance to see the case study 
I sent yesterday about your neighbor's results?"
```

**Key Points to Hit:**
- Acknowledge the trust problem directly
- Differentiate: local, veteran-owned, not a call center
- Reference the case study (continuity from Day 5)
- Ask if they've reviewed the material

**If They Push Back:**
```
"I totally get it—there's a lot of noise out there. 
What would help you feel more comfortable? Would it help 
if I just showed you the math for your specific home, 
no pressure, just information?"
```

---

### DAY 8: URGENCY EMAIL + SMS PUSH

**Action:** Send Email 4 (Urgency + SMS Opt-in CTA)

**Critical Step:** This email pushes the "Text SOLAR to [Code]" call-to-action

**Email Elements:**
1. Light urgency (incentive deadline, utility rate changes)
2. Quick-win offer (free analysis, no-commitment consultation)
3. SMS opt-in CTA: "Text SOLAR to [Your Number] for instant quote"

**Why SMS:**
- SMS has 98% open rate vs. 20% for email
- Text consent = explicit TCPA opt-in for future texts
- Creates direct, immediate communication channel

---

### DAY 9: BREAK-UP CALL

**Goal:** Elicit a "No" or a "Yes"—remove the "Maybe"

**Call Script (Negative Reverse):**
```
"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from Admiral Energy. 
I haven't heard back from you, so I'm going to assume 
solar isn't a priority for your home right now?"
```

**Psychology:** People fight to correct you if they are interested. This approach:
- Gives them an easy out if genuinely uninterested
- Triggers response from those who ARE interested but busy
- Removes limbo leads from active pipeline

**If They Say "No, Actually I Am Interested":**
```
"Great—I didn't want to assume. What's been holding you back 
from scheduling a quick call to see the numbers? 
I can do 15 minutes anytime this week."
```

**If They Confirm Not Interested:**
```
"No problem at all. Mind if I ask—is it the timing, 
or did you have a concern about solar in general? 
I ask because it helps us understand what homeowners 
are really looking for."
```
(Capture the insight for market intelligence)

---

### DAY 12: FINAL NUDGE EMAIL

**Action:** Send Email 5 (Multiple Channel Reminder)

**Content:**
- Brief recap of what you've sent
- Restate the value proposition
- Offer multiple response options: email, call, text, website
- Clear "last chance" framing without being pushy

**Subject Line Examples:**
- "Quick question before I close your file"
- "Should I follow up next quarter instead?"
- "One last thing about [Their County] solar incentives"

---

### DAY 14: RECYCLE OR NURTURE

**Decision Point:**

| Outcome | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **Appointment Booked** | Move to Closer pipeline |
| **Expressed Future Interest** | Schedule specific follow-up date |
| **No Response, No Opt-Out** | Long-Term Nurture (1 email/month) |
| **Opted Out** | Mark DNC, remove from all lists |

**Long-Term Nurture:**
- 1 email per month maximum
- Value-focused content (no hard sells)
- Seasonal triggers (summer = high bill season, winter = battery backup)
- Do NOT continue calling (preserves phone number reputation)

---

# SECTION 3: CRITICAL EXECUTION RULES

## 3.1 Do's and Don'ts

| Category | DO | DON'T |
|----------|-----|-------|
| **Phone Numbers** | Rotate Caller IDs across calls | Use same number all day (triggers spam flags) |
| **Opening Line** | Be direct about who you are | Say "How are you today?" (sales tell) |
| **NC Context** | Mention storms/outages (grid anxiety) | Ignore local relevance |
| **Tone** | Low & slow (signals authority) | Rush or sound hyper (signals desperation) |
| **TCPA** | Manual dials unless explicit opt-in | Auto-dial without written consent |
| **Frequency** | Max 3 attempts per lead in 24 hours | Call 5-10 times in one day |

## 3.2 The NC Curiosity Hook

Instead of pitching savings immediately:

```
"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] with Admiral Energy. 
I'm calling because many homeowners in [City/County] 
are seeing their Duke Energy rates jump this year, 
and I wanted to see if you've looked into the new 
2025 tax credits that can help offset that?"
```

**Why This Works:**
- Local relevance (Duke Energy + their area) ✓
- Pain point (rate jumps) ✓
- Curiosity trigger (new tax credits) ✓
- Question invites dialogue ✓
- All in under 15 seconds ✓

# SECTION 5: CADENCE TEMPLATES

## 5.1 Email Templates

### Email 1: Lead Magnet Delivery
```
Subject: Your NC Solar Savings Guide

Hi [First Name],

Thanks for requesting our Solar Savings Checklist for NC homeowners.

Here's the link: [LINK]

Inside, you'll find:
- How the 30% federal tax credit actually works (spoiler: it's better than most think)
- NC-specific incentives you might not know about
- The 3-minute calculation to see if solar makes sense for YOUR home

I'll give you a quick call to make sure this arrived okay. No pitch—just making sure you got it.

Best,
[Your Name]
Admiral Energy | [City], NC
[Phone]
```

### Email 3: Local Case Study
```
Subject: How your neighbor in [County] cut their bill by 65%

Hi [First Name],

Wanted to share a quick story from [Neighbor's City/County].

[Neighbor Name] was paying $280/month to Duke Energy. 
After going solar with us last spring, they now pay $98/month 
for their energy + solar payment combined.

That's $182/month in their pocket—and a locked-in rate 
that won't change when Duke raises prices again.

Their system: 22 panels, 8.8 kW, with battery backup.
Their incentives: $8,400 federal tax credit + $1,200 NC rebate.

Curious if you'd see similar results?

Reply and I'll run a quick analysis for your home. Takes 5 minutes, 
no commitment required.

[Your Name]
```

### Email 5: Final Nudge
```
Subject: Should I close your file?

Hi [First Name],

I've sent you a few resources over the past couple weeks—
the solar guide, the case study from [County], 
and info on the incentives available this year.

I don't want to be a bother, so this is my last email unless 
you'd like to continue the conversation.

If timing isn't right, no worries at all. 
I'll check back in a few months when things settle.

But if you ARE still curious about those Duke Energy bills 
and want to see some real numbers for your home, 
just reply "yes" and I'll send over a quick analysis.

Either way, I appreciate your time.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

# SECTION 6: CADENCE METRICS DASHBOARD

## 6.1 KPIs to Track Per Cadence

| Metric | Calculation | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Cadence Completion Rate** | Leads completing all touches ÷ Total leads | 70%+ |
| **Email Open Rate** | Opens ÷ Sends × 100 | 35%+ |
| **Email Reply Rate** | Replies ÷ Sends × 100 | 5%+ |
| **Call Connect Rate (by day)** | Connects ÷ Dials × 100 | 15%+ |
| **Cadence-to-Appointment Rate** | Appointments ÷ Leads entering cadence | 10%+ |
| **Opt-Out Rate** | Opt-outs ÷ Total leads | <5% |

## 6.2 Stage Conversion Funnel

```
Lead Enters Cadence:     100 leads
├── Day 0 Call Connect:   18 leads (18%)
├── Day 2 Call Connect:   12 leads (12%)
├── Day 6 Call Connect:   15 leads (15%)
├── Day 9 Call Connect:   10 leads (10%)
└── Total Appointments:   12 leads (12% cadence conversion)
```

**If Your Funnel Shows:**
- Low Day 0 connects → Speed-to-lead too slow
- High opt-outs after Day 6 → Too aggressive, soften approach
- Low appointment rate despite connects → Weak ask/qualification
