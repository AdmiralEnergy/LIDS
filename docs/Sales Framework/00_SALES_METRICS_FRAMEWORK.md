# PART 1: METRICS WE TRACK

## 1.1 Activity Metrics (What You DO)

These are leading indicators—they predict future results.

| Metric | Formula | Why We Track It |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| **Dials per Hour** | Total outbound attempts ÷ Hours worked | Measures work capacity |
| **Dials per Day** | Total outbound attempts in shift | Baseline activity level |
| **Connect Rate** | Answered calls ÷ Total dials × 100 | Measures list quality + timing |
| **Sub-30s Drop Rate** | Calls ending <30s ÷ Answered calls × 100 | **Measures opener effectiveness** |
| **2+ Minute Rate** | Calls lasting 2+ min ÷ Answered calls × 100 | Measures engagement quality |

### Why Sub-30s Drop Rate Matters Most

Research shows prospects decide within **5-10 seconds** whether to continue or hang up. By 30 seconds, 82% have made their decision. Your Sub-30s Drop Rate is the clearest measure of whether your opener is working.

```
High Sub-30s Drop Rate (>70%) = Your opener needs work
Low Sub-30s Drop Rate (<35%) = Your opener is capturing attention
```

---

## 1.2 Conversion Metrics (What You ACHIEVE)

| Metric | Formula | Why We Track It |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| **Call-to-Appointment Rate** | Appointments set ÷ Answered calls × 100 | **Primary performance measure** |
| **Appointments per Day** | Total appointments set in shift | Output volume |
| **Appointments per Week** | Weekly total | Consistency check |
| **Appointment Show Rate** | Appointments held ÷ Appointments set × 100 | Measures qualification quality |

### Industry Benchmarks

| Performance Level | Call-to-Appointment Rate |
|-------------------|-------------------------|
| Industry Average | ~2% |
| Targeted Approach | ~4% |
| Multi-Channel Cadence | 5-7% |
| Elite (Precision + Intel) | 6.7%+ |

---

## 1.3 Quality Metrics (HOW You Perform)

| Metric | Formula | Why We Track It |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| **Talk Ratio** | Rep speaking time ÷ Total call time × 100 | Listening vs. lecturing |
| **CRM Log Rate** | Logged calls ÷ Total calls × 100 | Data discipline |
| **Insight Capture Rate** | Calls with insights logged ÷ Total connects × 100 | Market intelligence value |
| **Follow-Up Rate** | Callbacks made ÷ Callbacks committed × 100 | Reliability |

### Optimal Talk Ratio

| Talk Ratio | Interpretation |
|------------|----------------|
| **>70%** | Lecturing—not listening enough |
| **50-65%** | Acceptable but room for improvement |
| **40-50%** | **OPTIMAL**—balanced dialogue |
| **<30%** | Too passive—not guiding conversation |

---

## 1.4 Compliance Metrics (Non-Negotiable)

| Metric | Required Standard | Consequence of Failure |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **DNC Compliance Rate** | **100%** | $500-$50,120 per violation |
| **Call Time Compliance** | **100%** | $500-$1,500 per violation |
| **Consent Documentation** | **100%** | Lawsuit exposure |
| **Opt-Out Processing** | Within 24 hours | TCPA violation |

**These are not performance tiers—they are binary requirements.**

# PART 3: UNDERSTANDING YOUR NUMBERS

## 3.1 What Each Metric Tells You

### If Your Connect Rate is Low (<8%):

  - Phone number flagged as spam
  - Poor lead list quality
- **Solutions:**
  - Optimize call timing (Tues/Wed 10-11am best)

  - Audit lead source quality

### If Your Sub-30s Drop Rate is High (>70%):
- **Possible Causes:**
  - Opener sounds scripted/robotic
  - Not creating immediate relevance
  - Tone too enthusiastic or pushy
- **Solutions:**

  - Slow down, lower pitch

### If Your 2+ Minute Rate is Low (<15%):
- **Possible Causes:**
  - Not asking engaging questions
  - Talking too much, not listening
  - Missing curiosity hooks
- **Solutions:**
  - Ask more open-ended questions
  - Reduce talk ratio below 50%
  - Use curiosity-based discovery

### If Your Call-to-Appointment Rate is Low (<2%):
- **Possible Causes:**
  - Not clearly asking for the appointment
  - Poor qualification (wasting time on unqualified prospects)
  - Weak value proposition
- **Solutions:**
